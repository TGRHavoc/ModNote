## ModNote

ModNote is a program that is designed to aid students with their revision by making notetaking
a little easier.
ModNote allows the user to create new modules, edit already created
modules and allows the user to create, edit and delete notes associated with the modules.
When editing modules the user can see whether the dates for their assignments have passed
as the assignments whose dates have passed are shown with an orange-red background colour
with yellow text. Each module allows the user to associate multiple notes with it, allowing
each note to have a unique title to differentiate between the different notes.

### Running the program

To run the program, simply run the .exe file that is located in the "Release" folder located in the main directory.
The program should automatically find the "modules" folder however, if it doesn't then select the "modules" folder that is located in the same directory as the application.
